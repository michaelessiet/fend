## Changelog

### v1.2.2 (2023-09-14)

* Add crate features to control the TLS implementation: enabling `native-tls`
    will cause fend to use the operating system's built-in TLS implementation.
    The `rustls` feature, which is enabled by default, will keep the existing
    native Rust implementation. When both features are disabled, such as when
    compiling with `--no-default-features`, network connectivity will not be
    available and currency conversions will not work.
    (by [@eatradish](https://github.com/eatradish))
* Add "zł" as an alias for Polish złoty (PLN) (by [@twolodzko](https://github.com/twolodzko))
* Add AOSC OS package and installation instructions (by [@eatradish](https://github.com/eatradish))
* Use `windows-sys` instead of `winapi`

### v1.2.1 (2023-09-06)

* Add Chinese units `jin` and `gongjin` (by [@eatradish](https://github.com/eatradish))
* Add Xbps (Void Linux) package (by [@tranzystorek-io](https://github.com/tranzystorek-io))
* Add MacPorts package (by [@herbygillot](https://github.com/herbygillot))

### v1.2.0 (2023-06-02)

* Variable names with underscores can now be correctly referenced
* Combined abbreviated units are now parsed case-insensitively:
    ```
    > 100 kwh
    100 kWh
    > 64 KB
    64 kB
    ```
* Add a new configuration option `enable-internet-access` (defaults to `true`)
* Add `tbs` unit as an abbreviation for tablespoons
* Add `thou` unit, representing a thousandth of an inch

### v1.1.6 (2023-04-03)

* Add cup, tablespoon and teaspoon units (by [@elcste](https://github.com/elcste))
* Add `bin` alias for binary (by [@xfnw](https://github.com/xfnw))
* Change the internal implementation of exchange rate handlers (by [@SekoiaTree](https://github.com/SekoiaTree))
* Fix unit test failures on 32-bit systems

### v1.1.5 (2023-02-06)

* Add `@no_trailing_newline` attribute, which causes fend to not print a trailing
    newline after the calculation.
    ```
    $ fend @no_trailing_newline 5+5
    10
    ```

### v1.1.4 (2023-01-08)

* Add support for subtracting from dates (e.g. `@2023-01-08 - 5 days`)
* Fix some trigonometric functions behaving incorrectly when passing in values with units

### v1.1.3 (2022-11-28)

* Add operators for permutations and combinations (by [@frectonz](https://github.com/frectonz))
    * `n permute k` or `n nPr k`: compute the number of `k`-permutations of `n`
    * `n choose k` or `n nCr k`: number of `k`-combinations of `n`
* Add `@noapprox` attribute to hide the `approx.` annotation in the output:
    ```
    > pi
    approx. 3.1415926535
    > @noapprox pi
    3.1415926535
    ```
* Add `@plain_number` attribute, to remove `approx.` and any units. This is especially useful in automated scripts.
    ```
    > 5 m / (3 s)
    approx. 1.6666666666 m / s
    > @plain_number 5 m / (3 s)
    1.6666666666
    ```

* Improve fend-web performance by serializing/storing variables properly
* Support case-insensitive currencies
* Support currency exchange rates in fend-wasm (by [@NickGeek](https://github.com/NickGeek))
* Support using any base currency for exchange rate calculations, not just USD

### v1.1.1 (2022-09-23)

* Add bitwise operators:
    * `&`: bitwise AND
    * `|`: bitwise OR
    * `xor`: bitwise XOR (`^` is already used for exponentiation)
    * `<<`: left shift
    * `>>`: right shift

### v1.1.0 (2022-09-22)

* Automatically download up-to-date currency exchange rates,
    e.g. when calculating `10 EUR to USD`
* fend can now read directly from files, e.g. `fend calculation.txt` will
    read and evaluate the contents of `calculation.txt`. Multiple files can be
    specified, as well as combinations of files and expressions.
* Shebangs (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env fend`) no longer result in parse errors
* You can now use `--` to force fend to interpret arguments literally,
    e.g. `fend -- -V` is interpreted as `-1 volts` instead of showing the version number
* Fix bug where trailing whitespace or comments would result in a parse error
* Add a man page
* Add an MSI installer for Windows
* Remove MSIX installer, which was difficult to use due to it being unsigned
* Change fend website to [https://printfn.github.io/fend](https://printfn.github.io/fend)
* Move fend documentation to
    [https://printfn.github.io/fend/documentation](https://printfn.github.io/fend/documentation)
* Add a fend package to the Windows Package Manager (`winget`)

### v1.0.5 (2022-08-14)

* Add a `fend-wasm-nodejs` NPM package
* Add a [Telegram bot](https://t.me/fend_calc_bot)

* Add a Markdown-like parsing mode to the WASM API

### v1.0.4 (2022-07-22)

* Support `kn` for `knots`
* Add an installer for Windows

### v1.0.3 (2022-06-07)

* Use Coulomb and Farad for prefixed units like `mC` or `µF`
* Add `sqmm` unit for square millimeters
* Add `point` unit for typographical points (i.e. 1/72 inch)
* Improve CLI behavior when pressing Ctrl-C to clear the current line

### v1.0.1 (2022-03-19)

* Support omitting inches when writing e.g. `5'1`: fend will now automatically
    interpret that as `5'1"`
* Improve reliability when piping data into fend on the command line, e.g.
    when running `echo "1+1" | fend`
* Support compiling fend with Rust 1.56 (rather than requiring Rust 1.59)

### v1.0.0 (2022-03-12)

* Allow `kmh` and `km/h` for kilometers per hour
* Change Planck's constant from `h` to `planck`
* Add support for lambda notation `λx.x` (in addition to the previous
    lambda notations `\x.x`, `x:x` and `x => x`)
* Add a ZSH helper script that makes `fend` more convenient on the
    command line
* Despite the major version bump, this release contains no breaking
    API changes

### v0.1.29 (2022-02-23)

* The locations for the config and history files have changed on some operating
    systems. On Linux and macOS, fend will now look in `~/.config/fend/config.toml`
    for its configuration file, and store history in `~/.local/state/fend/history`.
    You can run `fend help` to see which paths fend uses, and override them
    via the `FEND_CONFIG_DIR` and `FEND_STATE_DIR` environment variables
    if necessary.
* Colors in the CLI are now enabled by default. They can be disabled via the
    `enable-colors` config option, or via the `NO_COLOR` environment variable.
    `CLICOLOR` and `CLICOLOR_FORCE` environment variables are also respected.
    See https://bixense.com/clicolors/ and https://no-color.org for more info.
* Add a `max-history-size` config option to control how many history entries are
    saved by default.
* Improve error-checking when reading the config file. Minor errors will now only
    produce warnings, and no longer cause parsing to fail entirely.
* There are now Linux ARM builds available, for both `armv7-gnueabihf` and
    `aarch64` architectures.

### v0.1.28 (2022-02-12)

* Add base names `ternary` and `senary`
* Reduce CLI binary sizes

### v0.1.27 (2021-11-02)

* Improve command-line argument parsing, including support for multiple arguments
* The most recent calculation result is now stored in a special variable `_` (or `ans`):
    ```
    > 5 * 10
    50
    > _ + 5
    55
    > _ * 2
    110
    > ans * 2
    220
    ```

### v0.1.26 (2021-09-27)

    ```
    > roll d6
    4
    > roll d20 # 20-sided die
    17
    > roll 2d6 # sum of two 6-sided dice
    7
    > 2d6 # view the probability distribution

### v0.1.15 (2021-05-20)

* Case-insensitive units: you can now write `5 Meters`
* Experimental date support:
  * You can create a date object like so:
    ```
    > "2021-05-20" to date
    Thursday, 20 May 2021
    ```
  * No other date-related functionality has been implemented yet, including no times/timezones, durations, date arithmetic or different date formats.
* fend now parses single and double quotes as feet and inches (instead of as string literals) in more situations, so you can once again write:
    ```
    > 1.2192 m to '
    4'
    ```
* The CLI program can now read options from a config file. Type `help` to find out where it is stored. The `config.toml` file can contain the following options:
    ```toml
    prompt = '> '
    color = false
    ```
* Terminal color support: this is disabled by default, so you'll need to create a config file containing `color = true` first.
